# UK-US Dialect Converter

## Overview
The UK-US Dialect Converter is a machine learning project that converts text between UK and US English dialects using a **T5 transformer model**. This project fine-tunes a pre-trained **T5-small** model to learn dialect differences and perform automatic translation.

## Features
✅ Converts UK English text to US English dialect.  
✅ Uses **Transformer-based NLP models** for translation.  
✅ Trained on small datasets but can be expanded for better accuracy.  
✅ **Customizable and scalable** for additional language variations.

## 📌 How to Run the Notebook
### **1️⃣ Clone or Download the Repository**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dialect-converter.git
cd dialect-converter
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tqdm
```

### **3️⃣ Open the Jupyter Notebook**
You can run the notebook using **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
- Navigate to `UK_US_Dialect_Converter.ipynb`
- Run all cells in order to train and test the model.

### **4️⃣ Train & Evaluate the Model**
- The notebook will automatically load the dataset and train a T5 model.
- Example inference is provided at the end of the notebook.

### **5️⃣ Save & Use the Model**
Once trained, the model is saved inside the `models/` directory and can be reused.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
- **Small training dataset**: Currently trained on a small number of examples. More data will improve accuracy.
- **Limited generalization**: May struggle with complex UK-US dialect transformations beyond common words.
- **Inference speed**: Transformer models can be slow for large-scale processing.

---

## 🚀 Potential Improvements
🔹 **Expand Dataset**: Use larger datasets for training.  
🔹 **Fine-Tune Better Models**: Experiment with GPT, BERT, or T5-large.  
🔹 **Deploy as an API**: Convert the model into a REST API using FastAPI.  
🔹 **Improve Performance**: Optimize for real-time conversion.

## ⏳ Handling Time Constraints
If you are short on time, consider:
- Using the **pre-trained T5 model** without fine-tuning.
- Running **only inference** on provided examples instead of training.
- Using **Google Colab** for GPU acceleration to train faster.
